# Facets downloader

This is a quickie util that will download all the facets made by Justin Maller. Since there was no place that had them all archived, I made this to scrape the site and download all original images. If you really enjoy his artwork, though, consider supporting him by buying one of his prints, shirts, or mobile app that features all of these images. 

The util takes a few minutes to run and download all the files; times vary depending on your internet speed. 

Images downloader are 2560x1440. 

There are 231 images totaling 180MB.
